1. Abstract
We have made Automobile and Bike rental system program, in this program we have made four class, one is Abstract class and other three are inherited classes, we have also made some virtual functions. We have also made Sign-up and Login-in system for our program; user can make an account, or he/she can login to their account. User can delete his / her booking and can re-book a vehicle.

2. Introduction
We have designed a motorcycle and Automobile rental system software based on concept of Abstract class and Inheritance; we have created different Classes for different type of vehicles.

3. Methodology/ Plan development to solve the Problem.
In the beginning we have made an abstract class which has different virtual function and a pure virtual function, id_ password. We have also made three inherited classes, Car, Truck, and bike. In those classes we have made different function for different companies like in Car class we have made different Companies string array like Mehran, Corolla, Honda, Suzuki. Similarly In truck and bike classes we have made different function string arrays. We also used if-else and switch structure to check the desired vehicle availability. In main function we have made a pointer array object of abstract class so that we can use other classes functions.

4. Specifications
We have made Login and signup system for the user, our program first asks the user to login or sign up, for signing up user cannot take a name which is already taken by another user, after signing up user can choose a vehicle which he/she want to select after that user can delete the booking and can re-book a vehicle again. User can also check his/her detail of booking and ID. We have also made logout button which clears the screen. If a vehicle is already booked by another user, the program prints that “This vehicle is already Taken by someone please select other vehicle”.
